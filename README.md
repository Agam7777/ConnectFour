**Connect Four Game**

Overview

This project is an implementation of the classic Connect Four game using Object-Oriented Programming principles in java. The game allows two players
to compete in a grid of 7 columns and 6 rows to connect four of their pieces either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

Features

Player vs. Player: Two players can take turns to play the game.
Game Board: A 7x6 grid provides the game board for players to place their pieces.
Win Detection: The program detects and declares the winner when a player connects four pieces.
Input Validation: Ensures valid moves and prevents cheating.
Reset and Replay: Players can start a new game or replay after finishing.
Object-Oriented Principles

The game is structured with a focus on OOP principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism to maintain a clean and organized
codebase. Key classes and their functionalities include:

Board: Represents the game board and handles piece placement and win detection.
Player: Represents a player, with attributes and methods for their moves.
Game: Manages the game loop, player turns, and game outcomes.
